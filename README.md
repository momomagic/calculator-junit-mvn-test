## Maven project for running JUNIT5 tests 

#####1. Clone the project 
#####2. import project as java project in Intellij
#####3. Clean and build project 


#### Can you run tests already written in '''mvn test'''


## Coding ideas 
- Write junit5 tests to cover other methods 
- Write divide method by applying TDD (tests first)
- Can yuu write junit5 tests in ScientificCalculatorTest to do follow
    * using stub to define returned value as false to check exception thrown
    * using stub to define returned value as true should make addition
    * using mock verify method to test that connect method has been called one time
